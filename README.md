# CS210_Final_Project
The second GitHub repository created by Alan Urbanek for CS 210; for the final!

## Content
This is where I'll update all code written by me for the CS 210 Final Project at Bradley University. Like the Midterm Project, progress is made in Milestones:
### Milestone 1
Writing a program that reads city country, name, and population data from a given .csv database. Following input from the user, a city can be searched for in the database or, more optimally, a cache of the 10 most recent searches with much faster lookup time.
### Milestone 2
Updating the program to allow for multiple methods of deletion from the cache when it is full (10 items): Least Frequency Used, FIFO, and Random.
### Milestone 3
Implementing a trie to load the database into on startup and searching that instead when the cache misses. (MUCH faster than re-searching the original database)
### Milestone 4
Using a separate automated script to test performance for each of the 3 cache deletion strategies.
Also includes a written report (and spreadsheet) on performance testing data.
